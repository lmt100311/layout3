There are also ways to create something into a great product. We can use plastic bottles to create pots to put flowers and plants. It takes some time but it is worth it and it is also a way of helping the environment. There is another way called upcycling. It is a little similar with recycling but upcycling only use waste and turn something into a new one which is more valuable than the old ones. It is sometimes called as "creative reuse".</p>
